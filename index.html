									<h2 class="major">The art of teaching</h2>
									<p>I am an artist, my art is teaching and my canvas are the wonderful brains of the children I teach. In addition to my professional degree, I have attended different diplomas, trainings and I do a lot of reading and research because I am always eager to constantly learn, study and think about better methods of teaching to children everything they need and enjoy it at the same time, because the best way in which they can learn something is by doing it and doing it with pleasure, only in this way can they make little people with exceptional abilities.</p>

									<h2 class="major">School Next Generation</h2>
									<p>My teaching methods are tailored to the child and their circumstances as well as those of their family. I implement and promote <i>school-from-home</i> learning, which allows your son or daughter to learn from home, taking advantage of innovative technological tools. This is most useful today due to the state of emergency the entire world is in.</p>

									<p>LExpertise is the sum of experience plus knowledge applied to a job, that is what I apply when I am passing on knowledge to your children. It can also be seen in some articles and instructions, which you can find on my blog, since I have written them for parents in such a way that they can consult them at any time as another guide to give their children the best education.</p>
